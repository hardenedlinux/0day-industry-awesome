## The Pricy trend of Sandbox Escape Vulnerabilities in 2025

You may be wondering why the price of sandbox escape vulnerabilities has "little" higher in 2025. The story begins on March 20, 2025, when Boris Larin and Igor Kuznetsov of Kaspersky [reported the CVE-2025-2783](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/405143032) to Google. This was an 0-day exploit in-the-wild that bypassed the Chrome sandbox and formed part of an exploit chain in [Operation ForumTroll](https://securelist.com/operation-forumtroll/115989/).

| Begins - Mar 20 2025 | 	You may be wondering why the price of sandbox escape vulnerabilities has "little" higher in 2025. The story begins on March 20, 2025, when Boris Larin and Igor Kuznetsov of Kaspersky [reported the CVE-2025-2783](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/405143032) to Google. This was an 0-day exploit in-the-wild that bypassed the Chrome sandbox and formed part of an exploit chain in [Operation ForumTroll](https://securelist.com/operation-forumtroll/115989/).|
|Quick Response from Google - Mar 25 2025| 	Google fix the issue by March 25, 2025. This rapid response underscored the urgency of security issues in the digital landscape. However, despite their significant contribution to enhancing Chrome's security, both reporters were ineligible for the bug bounty due to their residency in Russia which is fuc* unfortunate. 0day is not a technical IP, neither copyright nor patent can be claimed and present to the court. National level sanctions doesn't make sense to 0day market since there's no boundary in the cyber world. On Google's behalf, shouldn't give a shit about the residency as long as they get the high quality delivery. If it does, it'd be a "great success! US and A". |
|Emergence of Competitors - Apr 23 2025| 	Just one month later, another player entered the scene. A researcher Micky [reported a vulnerability](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/412578726) similar to CVE-2025-2783 that could also achieve a sandbox escape. In a remarkable turn of events, Micky received a $250,000 bounty from Google, amplifying the competition and interest in such exploits.|
|The Rise of 0-Day Firms - Aug 2025| As the year progressed, interest in sandbox escape vulnerabilities intensified. In August 2025, a UAE-based 0-day firm, Advanced Security Solutions, announced its willingness to pay $250,000 for sandbox escape vulnerabilities as any part of the exploit chain, particularly for mobile platforms. This offer set the stage for an escalating bidding war for valuable vulnerabilities.|
|Apple's Competitive Move| 	Not to be outdone, Apple joined the party in October 2025. They announced a bounty program that offered up to $300,000 for WebKit sandbox escapes, further enticing researchers and hackers alike. This move was strategic, aimed at attracting talent and preventing exploits that could compromise their mobile platforms.|
|Hacking Team confirmed to be back - October 27, 2025| Kaspersky disclosed [details regarding how the Memento Labs](https://securelist.com/forumtroll-apt-hacking-team-dante-spyware/117851/) (formerly Hacking Team) had exploited CVE-2025-2783 in their campaigns. The games continues... |
